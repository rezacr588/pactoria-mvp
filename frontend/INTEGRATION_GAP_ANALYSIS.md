## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Must Fix for Production)
- 🔴 POST /auth/login - User Registration & Login
- 🔴 GET /auth/me - User Registration & Login
- 🔴 GET /analytics/dashboard - Dashboard Data Loading
- 🔴 GET /contracts - Dashboard Data Loading
- 🔴 GET /contracts - Contract List & Search
- 🔴 GET /search/contracts/quick - Contract List & Search
- 🔴 GET /contracts/templates - Contract Creation
- 🔴 POST /contracts - Contract Creation
- 🔴 POST /auth/register - LoginPage
- 🔴 GET /contracts/{id} - ContractViewPage
- 🔴 PUT /contracts/{id} - ContractEditPage
- 🔴 DELETE /contracts/{id} - ContractActions
- 🔴 POST /contracts/{id}/generate - ContractGeneration
- 🔴 POST /contracts/{id}/analyze - ComplianceAnalysis
- 🔴 POST /search/contracts - AdvancedSearch

### Medium Priority (Should Fix Soon)
- 🟡 PUT /auth/me - SettingsPage
- 🟡 GET /analytics/business - AnalyticsPage
- 🟡 GET /analytics/time-series/{metric} - ChartsComponent
- 🟡 POST /search/users - UserSearch
- 🟡 POST /search/templates - TemplateSearch
- 🟡 GET /search/suggestions/contracts - SearchSuggestions
- 🟡 GET /search/facets/contracts - SearchFilters
- 🟡 POST /bulk/contracts/update - BulkOperations
- 🟡 POST /bulk/contracts/delete - BulkOperations
- 🟡 POST /bulk/contracts/export - ExportFeature

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
- 🟢 Performance optimizations
- 🟢 Additional error handling
- 🟢 UI/UX improvements

## Recommendations

1. Implement missing critical API endpoints to ensure core functionality works
2. Set up proper error handling for all API calls with user-friendly error messages
3. Add loading states and skeleton screens for better user experience
4. Implement retry mechanisms for failed API requests
5. Add comprehensive logging for API requests and responses
6. Set up API response caching where appropriate to improve performance
7. Implement proper authentication token refresh mechanisms
8. Add API endpoint monitoring and health checks
9. Create mock API responses for development and testing
10. Set up API documentation and contract testing
11. Fix failing API endpoints - check backend implementation and error responses
12. Consider implementing endpoints in phases, starting with critical user flows
13. Set up backend development environment and ensure API server is running
14. 15 critical endpoints are failing - these must be fixed before production

## Next Steps

### For MVP Launch:
1. **Fix all critical endpoints** - Ensure authentication and core contract management work
2. **Implement proper error handling** - Users should see meaningful error messages
3. **Set up backend monitoring** - Know when APIs are down
4. **Add loading states** - Improve user experience during API calls

### For Full Production:
1. **Implement remaining endpoints** - Complete all features
2. **Add comprehensive testing** - Unit, integration, and E2E tests
3. **Performance optimization** - Caching, lazy loading, pagination
4. **Security hardening** - Input validation, rate limiting, CORS

### For Long-term Success:
1. **API documentation** - Keep frontend and backend contracts in sync
2. **Monitoring and alerting** - Proactive issue detection
3. **Automated deployment** - CI/CD pipeline with integration tests
4. **Performance metrics** - Track API response times and error rates
