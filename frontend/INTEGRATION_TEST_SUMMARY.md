## Recommendations for Backend Integration

### 1. API Endpoint Implementation
Ensure the following endpoints are available:
- Authentication endpoints with proper token handling
- Contract CRUD endpoints with validation
- Analytics endpoints with proper data aggregation
- Search endpoints with filtering capabilities
- Bulk operation endpoints with progress tracking

### 2. Error Response Standardization
Implement consistent error response format:
```json
{
  "detail": "Error message",
  "error_code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "field_errors": {...}
}
```

### 3. WebSocket Implementation
- User authentication via WebSocket
- Real-time event broadcasting
- Connection health monitoring
- Graceful connection handling

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Response time optimization (<2s for most endpoints)
- Pagination for large datasets
- Caching strategies
- Rate limiting implementation

## Next Steps

### 1. Backend Integration
- Start backend services and run tests against live APIs
- Validate actual API responses match frontend expectations
- Test complete user journeys end-to-end

### 2. Test Refinement
- Fix authentication routing issues
- Improve form field selectors
- Enhance error message validation
- Add more edge case coverage

### 3. Continuous Integration

- Set up test data management
- Implement test result reporting
- Add performance regression testing

### 4. Monitoring Integration
- Add API monitoring and alerting
- Implement integration health checks
- Set up error tracking and logging
- Create integration dashboards
