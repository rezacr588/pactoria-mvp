## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Technology Recommendations

1. **Python + FastAPI** (Recommended)
   - Modern, fast, built-in OpenAPI docs
   - Excellent TypeScript integration
   - Great for AI/ML integration

2. **Node.js + Express/NestJS**
   - Same language as frontend
   - Good TypeScript support
   - Large ecosystem

3. **Database Options**
   - PostgreSQL (recommended for production)
   - SQLite (for development/MVP)

### Required Environment Setup

```bash
# Backend API Server
http://localhost:8000/api/v1  # Development
https://api.pactoria.com/v1   # Production

# Database
PostgreSQL with proper migrations

# AI Services
OpenAI API integration for contract generation
```

### API Response Format Standards

The frontend expects this exact response format:

```typescript
// Authentication responses
interface LoginResponse {
  token: {
    access_token: string;
    token_type: "Bearer";
    expires_in: number;
  };
  user: User;
  company: Company | null;
}

// Contract responses
interface ContractListResponse {
  contracts: Contract[];
  total: number;
  page: number;
  size: number;
  pages: number;
}

// Analytics responses
interface DashboardResponse {
  business_metrics: BusinessMetrics;
  user_metrics: UserMetrics;
  contract_types: ContractTypeMetrics[];
  compliance_metrics: ComplianceMetrics;
  // ... (see types/index.ts for complete schema)
}
```

## üìä Risk Assessment
